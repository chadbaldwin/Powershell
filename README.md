# Powershell
Random PowerShell scrips and projects

That's really all this is...It's not any one particular project. I'm just using GitHub to store some of my more complex but often used powershell scripts. If other people want to use them...then by all means, go ahead.

I'm not going to provide usage samples or in-depth descriptions. Most of the scripts are fairly short and/or well commented. Like I said, this is just a script dump for me.
